/**
 * Payment Service
 * 
 * This service handles all payment-related operations in the frontend application.
 * It communicates with the backend API to process payments, generate invoices,
 * and manage payment-related functionality for both customers and officers.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - @Injectable: Marks this class as a service that can be injected into components
 * - providedIn: 'root' - Makes this service available throughout the entire application
 * - HttpClient: Angular service for making HTTP requests to the backend
 * - Observable: RxJS concept for handling asynchronous data streams
 * - Blob: Binary data type for handling file downloads (PDF invoices)
 * 
 * Service Responsibilities:
 * 1. Process payment transactions
 * 2. Generate and retrieve invoices
 * 3. Download invoice PDFs
 * 4. Manage authentication headers for API calls
 * 5. Handle payment confirmation and status updates
