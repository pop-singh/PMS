/**
 * Feedback Model Interfaces
 * 
 * These interfaces define the structure of data used for feedback operations
 * in the courier management system. They ensure type safety and provide
 * clear contracts for data exchange between components and services.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Interface: TypeScript feature that defines the shape of an object
 * - Type Safety: Ensures data has the correct structure at compile time
 * - Optional Properties: Properties marked with ? are not required
 * - Data Contracts: Clear definition of what feedback data should look like
